React Naming Conventions:

- Use kebab-case for files and directories.

Components:

- Do not use 'use client' or 'use server' statements (this is an Astro project, not Next.js).
- Favour named exports for components.
- Keep components modular and reusable with a clear separation of concerns.
- Keep logic close to the component that needs it; loader components can own their data fetching with local state.
- Import only the React APIs you need (e.g. `import { useEffect } from 'react'`).
- `zod` and `react-hook-form` packages are installed—use them for validated forms.
- Always use `cn` from `@/lib/utils` for class name merging.
- If you see “useTRPCClient() can only be used inside of a <TRPCProvider>”, ensure the component rendering it is wrapped in `AppProvider` or an equivalent provider.

UI and Styling:

- Use shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Prefer shadcn components for UI building blocks before adding new dependencies.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS using a mobile-first approach.
